# general-election-2024
 The Centre for Cities constituency data tool provides local economic data for every parliamentary constituency in Great Britain. This repo contains the master sheet for the tool.
 
## Description 

The Centre for Cities constituency data tool combines combines different datasets to the new constituency map for the 2024 general election. This tool is available here: https://www.centreforcities.org/data/constituency-data-tool/

Much of this data is not currently available at the constituency level, so Centre for Cities has used data at small geographies (OAs/LSOAs/MSOAs) and assigned it to the new constituencies where they overlap.

This repo contains the final mastersheet produced for this tool for every constituency in Great Britain as a CSV. The workbook is available on request.
